Age
Gender
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Region (where the individual resides)
Smoking habit (smoker or not)
Children (number of children the individual has)
Insurance cost
Steps Performed

#Import Libraries:

Imported necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.  

#Read the Dataset:

Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.  

#Data Preprocessing:    

- Handled missing values.  
- Performed descriptive statistics on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, region, smoking habits, and the number of children.  

#Statistical Analysis:

- Applied the Central Limit Theorem.  
- Used preprocessing techniques and standard normal distribution.  
- Conducted inferential statistics, including:  
* Chi-square test  
* ANOVA test  
* Two-sample Z-test  

#Results  

The analysis provided insights into how different factors affect insurance costs. Detailed results and visualizations are available in the project notebooks.
